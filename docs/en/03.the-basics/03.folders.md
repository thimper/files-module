# Folders

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

Folders are the basic containers that hold files. Folders have a flat structure (can not be nested).


#### Folder Fields

Below is a list of `fields` in the `folders` stream. Fields are accessed as attributes:

    $folder->name;

Same goes for decorated instances in Twig:

    {{ folder.name }}
