# Configuration

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

You can override Files module configuration by publishing the addon and modifying the resulting configuration file:

```bash
php artisan addon:publish anomaly.module.files
```

The addon will be published to `/resources/{application}/addons/anomaly/files-module`.

#### MIME Types

The `anomaly.module.files::mimes.types` value tells the files module what `type` of file is associated with a given file extension.

If your project deals with strange file types feel free to add them here under the appropriate type.

> If you think an extension should be included in configuration please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/anomalylabs/files-module)!{.tip}
